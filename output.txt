Assume: f:S->T is a function and has an inverse function 
To Show: f is bijective
Hence:
1.   if f is exists then f is injective
2.   if f is exists then f is surjective

To show: (1)
if f is exists then f is injective
Assume: f is exists 
To Show: f is injective

Hence:
1.1   if s1,s2 in S and f(s1) = f(s2) then s1 = s2

To show: (1.1)
if s1,s2 in S and f(s1) = f(s2) then s1 = s2
Assume: s1,s2 in S and f(s1) = f(s2) 
To Show: s1 = s2

Hence:
Since f has an inverse function, let g:T->S be the inverse of f. Then, we have g(f(s1))=s1 and g(f(s2))=s2. Given f(s1)=f(s2), we have g(f(s1))=g(f(s2)), which implies that s1=s2.
Thus: s1 = s2

To show: (2)
if f is exists then f is surjective
Assume: f is exists 
To Show: f is surjective

Hence:
2.1   if t in T then there exists s in S such that f(s) = t

To show: (2.1)
if t in T then there exists s in S such that f(s) = t
Assume: t in T 
To Show: there exists s in S such that f(s) = t

Hence:
Since f has an inverse function, it is bijective. Therefore, for any t in T, there exists a unique s in S such that f(s) = t.
Thus: there exists s in S such that f(s) = t
